<p>Dear Java Colleagues, </p>
<p>Usually we have a custom app to register for the topics. Unfortunately, dusting off the old app after two years was not a sinecure. This is why this edition we welcome you to this Github page! 
You can do two things: </p>
<p><strong>Register for an existing topic</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, there are already some topics for the afternoon. We are excited to have colleagues present interesting topics and see some classics like the Capture The Flag Afternoon. Add your name through a comment, this way we know what room we need to reserve for the according topic! </p>
<p><strong>Add your own topic</strong></p>
<p>DevLabs is an afternoon where everyone is free to experiment with a technology of choice. So if you have a certain technology/hobby project/... that you never find time to explore or you&#39;re stuck with something and you are looking for colleagues with expertise to help each other out, be sure to register your own topic! This is done by &#39;create new issue&#39; and adding your name as a comment. This way, you can match up with other colleagues who have the same spark in their eyes with that certain topic!
Register your topic and see colleagues register for the same! You can collaborate closely or each work at your own pace, the choice is yours!
We will make open spots for all the topics and make some special arrangements when there are topics like IOT that require certain infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The full schedule for our DevLabs day is available at <a href="planning.html" target=_blank>the Planning page</a></p>
